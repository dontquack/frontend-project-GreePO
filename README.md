# **GreePO Project**    
GreePO project is a website of an architectural bureau. On these webpages you can find basic information about the company, its portfolio, and submit a request.  
This project is my first project on GitHub. Its main task is to practice basic skills in working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
  

### **The project used:**    
:white_check_mark: Flexible Box Layout Module;  
:white_check_mark: the Grid Layout;   
:white_check_mark: the project's home page is adaptive to the screen size of most devices.  

### **In the near future, the project expects:**  
:black_square_button: animation using Javascript;  
:black_square_button: Bootstrap framework.  

*I suggest you watch **a small preview of the GreePO**:*
