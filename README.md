# **GreePO Project**    
GreePO project is a website of an architectural bureau. On these webpages you can find basic information about the company, its portfolio, and submit a request.  
This project is my first project on GitHub. Its main task is to practice basic skills in working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
  

### **The project used:**    
:white_check_mark: Flexible Box Layout Module;  
:white_check_mark: the Grid Layout;
:white_check_mark: a bit of JavaScript animation;       

### **In the near future, the project expects:**  
:black_square_button: more adaptability;
:black_square_button: more interesting Projects section design (but I'm not sure?). 

*I suggest you watch **a small preview of the GreePO**:*
